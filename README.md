# Fiscal Fresh
This Repository holds the original code base that was developed during <i>QHacks 2020</i> - the Devpost can be found [here](https://devpost.com/software/fiscal-fresh).

In the weeks following the Hackathon, the project was further developed and improved. A stable running demo is [hosted online](http://fiscalfresh.herokuapp.com/) and the source code for it can be found [here](https://github.com/mike-briggs/FiscalFresh).

## Next Steps
Some future improvements that may be added:
- User accounts (currently you must sign in with an existing <i>Instacart</i> acount
- Demo or walkthrough of the features on the live site
